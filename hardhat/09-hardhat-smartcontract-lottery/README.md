# Getting Started

## Requirements

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

-   [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
        -   `node --version` and get an output like: `vx.x.x`
        -   It'll need to be at least `18.16.0` of node
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) instead of `npm`
    -   You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
        -   `yarn --version` and get an output like: `x.x.x`
        -   You might need to [install it with `npm`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or `corepack`

### Test Coverage

```
yarn hardhat coverage
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

-   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
    -   You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
-   `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH & LINK. You should see the ETH and LINK show up in your metamask. [You can read more on setting up your wallet with LINK.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/deploy-your-first-contract/#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet)

3. Setup a Chainlink VRF Subscription ID

Head over to [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/) and setup a new subscription, and get a subscriptionId. You can reuse an old subscription if you already have one.

[You can follow the instructions](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-a-random-number/) if you get lost. You should leave this step with:

1. A subscription ID
2. Your subscription should be funded with LINK

3.2 ## VERY IMPORTANT

Currently there is not possible to create a v2.0 VRF via WebPage.

In order to create a new one, you must go to [this VRF contract](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x8103b0a8a00be2ddc778e6e7eaa21791cd364625#writeContract), connect your Metamask, and create a subscription with the method 'createSubscription'.

Now you'll have one new contract in your VRF link account.

4. Deploy

In your `helper-hardhat-config.js` add your `subscriptionId` under the section of the chainId you're using (aka, if you're deploying to sepolia, add your `subscriptionId` in the `subscriptionId` field under the `11155111` section.)

Then run:

```
yarn hardhat deploy --network sepolia
```

And copy / remember the contract address.

5. Add your contract address as a Chainlink VRF Consumer

Go back to [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link) and under your subscription add `Add consumer` and add your contract address. You should also fund the contract with a minimum of 1 LINK.

6. Register a Chainlink Keepers Upkeep

## VERY IMPORTANT

-   Now is [Link Automation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation)

[You can follow the documentation if you get lost.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/compatible-contracts/)

Go to [keepers.chain.link](https://keepers.chain.link/new) and register a new upkeep. Choose `Custom logic` as your trigger mechanism for automation. Your UI will look something like this once completed:

![Keepers](./img/keepers.png)

6. Enter your raffle!

Your contract is now setup to be a tamper proof autonomous verifiably random lottery. Enter the lottery by running:

```
yarn hardhat run scripts/enter.js --network sepolia
```
